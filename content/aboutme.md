Hello and welcome to my cybersecurity blog! I'm a vet and cybersecurity nerd just trying to improve myself every day. My hope is that by maintaining this blog I'll be able to share things I learn with people and chronicle my successes and failures for your enjoyment or learning pleasure. 

I hope you enjoy your stay and if you have feedback feel free to reach out through the links on my homepage!
